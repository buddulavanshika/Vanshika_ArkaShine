# ðŸŒ± Soil Nutrient Predictor using Spectroscopy and Machine Learning

This project aims to provide a real-time, non-invasive system for analyzing soil health by predicting key nutrient concentrations using visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopic data. The system leverages machine learning models to interpret spectral reflectance and offers an intuitive user interface through a Streamlit web application.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Conventional soil analysis methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. They often delay critical agricultural decisions like fertilization planning and crop selection. This project addresses these limitations by developing a machine learning-based system capable of accurately predicting soil nutrient concentrations based on reflectance at different wavelengths. The project integrates an easy-to-use web interface to ensure accessibility for farmers, researchers, and agronomists.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Original Samples:** 100 rows of soil spectral and nutrient data.
- **Interpolation Applied:** Dataset expanded to 1000 samples for better model training.
- **Input Features (18):** Spectral reflectance at wavelengths (e.g., A(410), B(435), ..., T(730)).
- **Target Variables (13):** Soil properties and nutrient levels such as:
  - pH
  - EC (dS/m)
  - Organic Carbon (OC %)
  - P, K, Ca, Mg (macronutrients)
  - S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B (micronutrients)

## Feature Importance

Permutation importance was used to determine which spectral bands (wavelengths) contributed most to each nutrient prediction. This enhances model interpretability and informs band selection for future models.
